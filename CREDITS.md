Portfolio template based on work by Jinzurei (@jinzurei)
Original repo: https://github.com/jinzurei/Portfolio

GLSL shaders and WebGL animation: created by Jinzurei (contained in `/shaders` and `scripts/background.js`)
Background smoke/ink B-roll video: Dan Cristian PƒÉdure»õ (Pexels) ‚Äî used as a visual layer only
Built with Three.js for WebGL rendering
```

Notes:
- The GLSL shader code and the JavaScript that drives the animation (including uniform wiring and scene composition) are original work by **Jinzurei**.
- The Pexels smoke/ink footage is used as a visual overlay/background only and was not authored by the project owner.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Glassmorphism)
- JavaScript ES6+
- Three.js (WebGL/GLSL shaders)
- Intersection Observer API

### Detailed technologies & tooling

- **Three.js (v0.158.0)** ‚Äî used to initialize the WebGL renderer, camera, and shader materials. See `scripts/background.js` for the runtime setup and shader loading.
- **GLSL shaders** ‚Äî custom vertex and fragment shaders are stored in `/shaders` (e.g., `contour.vert`, `contour.frag`). These implement noise-driven contour bands, color gradients, and occasional glitch bursts.
- **Image assets** ‚Äî optimized WebP images live in `/photos`. Where necessary, JPEG/PNG fallbacks are included for older browsers.
- **Performance & accessibility** ‚Äî uses `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, `focus-visible` styles, semantic HTML, and ARIA attributes to meet accessibility targets (WCAG 2.1 AA where practical).
- **Developer tooling (recommended)** ‚Äî EditorConfig, Prettier, and ESLint are recommended for consistency when contributing. No build step or package manager is required to run the project locally.
